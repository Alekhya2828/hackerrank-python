https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-1

### Problem

In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. 

**Task**

In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.

Obs. this is just an question and answer problem in HackerRank.

### My Solution

- [Python 2 (only built-in)](python2.py)
- [Python 3 (only built-in)](python3.py)
- [Python 3 (with numpy)](python3-numpy.py)
