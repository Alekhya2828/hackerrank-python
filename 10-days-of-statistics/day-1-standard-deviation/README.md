# Day 1: Standard Deviation

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-standard-deviation

### Problem

In this challenge, we practice calculating standard deviation.

**Task**

Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate and print the standard deviation. 
Your answer should be in decimal form, rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3 format). 
An error margin of +-0.1 will be tolerated for the standard deviation.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of elements in the array.   
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing the array's elements. 

**Output Format**

Print the standard deviation on a new line, rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e., 12.3 format).

**Sample Input 0**

```
5
10 40 30 50 20
```

**Sample Output 0**

```
14.1
```
