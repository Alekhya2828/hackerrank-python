https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-spearman-rank-correlation-coefficient

### Problem

In this challenge, we practice calculating Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. 

**Task**

Given two n-element data sets, X and Y, calculate the value of the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the size of data sets X and Y.  
The second line contains n space-separated real numbers (scaled to at most one decimal place), defining data set X.  
The third line contains n space-separated real numbers (scaled to at most one decimal place), defining data set Y. 

**Output Format**

Print the value of the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places.

**Sample Input**

```
10
10 9.8 8 7.8 7.7 1.7 6 5 1.4 2 
200 44 32 24 22 17 15 12 8 4
```

**Sample Output**

```
0.903
```
