https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-poisson-distribution-1

### Problem

In this challenge, we learn about Poisson distributions.  

**Task**

A random variable, X, follows Poisson distribution with mean of 2.5. 
Find the probability with which the random variable X is equal to 5.

**Input Format**

The first line contains X's mean. The second line contains the value we want the probability for:

```
2.5
5
```

**Output Format**. 

Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format).

```
0.067
```

### My Solution
