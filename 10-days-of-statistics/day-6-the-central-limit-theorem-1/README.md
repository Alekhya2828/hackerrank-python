# Day 6: The Central Limit Theorem I

https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-the-central-limit-theorem-1

### Problem

In this challenge, we practice solving problems based on the Central Limit Theorem.  

**Task**

A large elevator can transport a maximum of 9800 pounds.  
Suppose a load of cargo containing 49 boxes must be transported via the elevator.   
The box weight of this type of cargo follows a distribution with a mean of µ=205 pounds and a standard deviation of σ=15 pounds.   
Based on this information, what is the probability that all 49 boxes can be safely loaded into the freight elevator and transported?  

**Input Format**

There are 4 lines of input (shown below):

```
9800
49
205
15
```

The first line contains the maximum weight the elevator can transport. 
The second line contains the number of boxes in the cargo. 
The third line contains the mean weight of a cargo box, and the fourth line contains its standard deviation.  

**Output Format**

Print the probability that the elevator can successfully transport all 49 boxes, rounded to a scale of 4 decimal places (i.e., 1.2345 format).
