https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-geometric-distribution-2

### Problem

In this challenge, we learn about geometric distributions.  

**Task**

The probability that a machine produces a defective product is 1/3. What is the probability that the 1<sup>st</sup> defect is found during the first inspections?

**Input Format**

The first line contains the respective space-separated numerator and denominator for the probability of a defect, and the second line contains the inspection we want the probability of the first defect being discovered by:

```
1 3
5
```

**Output Format**. 

Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format).

```
0.868
```

### My Solution
