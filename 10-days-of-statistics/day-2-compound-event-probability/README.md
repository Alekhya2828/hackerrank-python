https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/s10-mcq-3

### Problem

In this challenge, we practice calculating the probability of a compound event.

**Task**

There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z. 

Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls. 

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?
