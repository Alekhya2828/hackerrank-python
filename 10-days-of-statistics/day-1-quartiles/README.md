### Problem

In this challenge, we practice calculating quartiles. 

**Task**

Given an array, X, of N integers, calculate the respective first quartile (Q1), second quartile (Q2), and third quartile (Q3). It is guaranteed that Q1, Q2, and Q3 are integers.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of elements in the array.   
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing the array's elements.  

**Output Format**

Print 3 lines of output in the following order:  

1. The first line should be the value of Q1.  
2. The second line should be the value of Q2.  
3. The third line should be the value of Q3.

**Sample Input 0**
